# rage-against-the-api-42

This is a Rush project for school 42 (Unit Factory, Kyiv, Ukraine).

The idea is to create an application which allows user to find out the way through Paris metro system from starting to final point. For this you need to use RAPT (basically Paris metro api). Used technologies: React js, Node js and some algorithm magic.

Inctructions:
1. Clone repo.
2. Open containing folder.
3. Run 'npm i && node server.js'
4. Open separate console window. Navigate to client folder.
5. Run 'npm i && npm start'.
